/**
 * Markup for the one real 3D object in the splash scene.
 *
 * The floor projects a viewport-adaptive field of independently choreographed tiles through one Canvas
 * owner. Only this cube participates in `preserve-3d`, so moving the shared camera reprojects the logo
 * without turning startup into hundreds or thousands of composited DOM or 3D layers.
 *
 * The camera never rotates around the cube, only from its initial tilt to directly overhead. Consequently
 * the same two walls stay visible until they become edge-on; the two permanently hidden walls and the base
 * are intentionally absent rather than paid for and hidden.
